# urlShortenTool

使用rebrandly api和ajax技术制作的url缩短工具
主要使用的是AJAX中的fetch
The fetch() function:
Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.

根据MDN的解释：https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
